\description{
Empirical Bayesian meta-analysis with random-effect (RE) or fixed-effect (FE). For the estimation of
tau^2 an Empirical Bayesian method was used utilizing DerSimonian and Laird (1986) or DSL estimator.
This approach is easy but intervals are slightly smaller (O Bai et al. 2016). That being said the between study
variance is therefore treated as having an improper uniform prior, which simplifies most calculations.

The heuristic methods was (naive) attempt to formulate an approximation to a closed form solution. I started with a
simple method of moment estimator but did not progress further. The HE is still rather empirical and results in similar results to the DSL and REML approach.
\eqn{\tau^2 = \max\left(0, \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{\theta_i} - \theta_{\text{pooled}})^2 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \cdot se_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} \right)}
However, HE will create wider intervals over the estimate under smaller sample sizes. Yet, by default DSL is still
preferred.
